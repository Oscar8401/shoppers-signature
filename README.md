# The Shoppers' Signature

Hello Shoppers! This is your email signature generator! :boom:  

To use it, access [The Shoppers' Signature](https://jlozovei.github.io/shoppers-signature/), enter your data, hit `Copy to clipboard` and paste the result into your email signature! Simple, isn't it?  

Made with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and styled by [@jlozovei](https://github.com/jlozovei).  

## Build and Test setup (for developers)

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```

For some reason (yet) I don't know why, when running local server for development `Signature.vue` module is taking to long to compile/build - maybe it's the html markup for the signature (email marketing tables), or maybe it's something else. :worried:  

## Also important

If any errors occur during build/test, try these commands:

``` bash
# install webpack
npm install -g webpack

# install webpack-dev-server
npm install -g webpack-dev-server

# install vue-cli
npm install -g vue-cli
```
